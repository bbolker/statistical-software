# What is (open-source) statistical software and how can it be validated, tested, and reviewed?

A repo of ideas and explorations for rOpenSci’s project on peer-reviewed
statistical software. The project will address the following three
primary threads:

## 1\. Peer Review

No concrete developments to date

## 2\. Statistical Software

### 2.1 Summary

The project requires a degree of consensus on the scope of “Statistical
Software”. One of the primary, coherent bodies of reference for
statistical software is the eponymous [academic
journal](https://www.jstatsoft.org). The following summarises detailed
explorations in a [sub-directory of this
repository](https://github.com/mpadge/statistical-software/tree/master/jss),
involving code to extract and analyse the abstracts of all articles
published by the Journal of Statistical Software. Textual descriptions
of statistical software are very generic and homogeneous, and have
become more so over time, most notably from around 2008 onwards. It is
therefore difficult to apply standard “text mining” algorithms to
discern topics, clusters, or other textual phenomena which might help to
distinguish categories of statistical software. The following
nevertheless provides a brief list of nouns which define potentially
distinct topics within the broader realm of statistical software:
